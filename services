# Proxmox

I ended up choosing Proxmox over TrueNAS Scale because, after testing both, Proxmox felt far more versatile. At one point, I even tried running TrueNAS Scale inside Proxmox, but that quickly proved impractical—I had created a ZFS storage pool in TrueNAS and then passed it through to Proxmox, which felt like a fragile setup just waiting to cause problems. Since I didn’t really see the benefit of running containers or VMs inside TrueNAS on top of Proxmox, I eventually scrapped it. Instead, I set up a Samba share in a container, mounting my ZFS pool directly there.

One thing I learned too late was about RAIDZ1 vs RAIDZ2. It turns out RAIDZ1 is generally not recommended for drives larger than 2TB, and I had four 3TB drives in my pool. This is because in the event of drive failure, the resilvering process takes much longer on a larger drive. During that time, the chance of encountering an issue increases significantly, which would then cause the rebuild to fail and result in data loss. RAIDZ2 provides an extra layer of redundancy by allowing two drives to fail before the pool is at risk, which makes it far safer for larger capacity disks.
